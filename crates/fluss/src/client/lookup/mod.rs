//! Lookup client implementation with batching and queuing support.
//!
//! This module provides a high-throughput lookup client that batches multiple
//! lookup operations together to reduce network round trips, achieving parity
//! with the Java client implementation.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let lookup_client = LookupClient::new(config, metadata);
//! let future = lookup_client.lookup(table_path, table_bucket, key_bytes);
//! let result = future.await?;
//! ```
