# Apache Fluss™ C++ Bindings (Incubating)

C++ bindings for Fluss, built on top of the [fluss-rust](../../crates/fluss) client. The API is exposed via a C++ header ([include/fluss.hpp](include/fluss.hpp)) and implemented with Rust FFI.

## Requirements

- Rust (see [rust-toolchain.toml](../../rust-toolchain.toml) at repo root)
- C++17-capable compiler
- CMake 3.18+ and/or Bazel
- Apache Arrow (for Arrow-based APIs)

## Build

From the repository root or from `bindings/cpp`:

**With CMake:**

```bash
cd bindings/cpp
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

**With Bazel:**

```bash
cd bindings/cpp
bazel build //...
```
See [ci.sh](ci.sh) for the CI build sequence.


## TODO

- [] How to introduce fluss-cpp in your own project, https://github.com/apache/opendal/blob/main/bindings/cpp/README.md is a good reference
- [ ] Add CMake/Bazel install and packaging instructions.
- [ ] Document API usage and minimal example in this README.
- [ ] Add more C++ examples (log scan, upsert, etc.).
