# Publish the fluss Rust crate to crates.io.
# Trigger: push tag only (e.g. v0.1.0).
# Pre-release tags (containing '-') do not publish; release tags publish to crates.io.
#
# First publish: add repo secret CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN (crates.io API token); CI will use it.
# After crate exists: set up Trusted Publishing on the crate page, then remove the secret; CI will use OIDC.
